	<p>1: I could make a cascading style sheet that the teachers can just pull styles from.</p>
	<p>2: The cascading style sheet will contain many different styles for colors and font sizes, we should also use this approach to keep the website consistent throughout other teacher's pages.
	<ol>
		<span class="subheading">Tags and classes</span>
		<li>body.math - This will apply a background color/image for all pages relating to math department</li>
		<li>body.science - This will apply a background color/image for all pages relating to science department</li>
		<li>table - Change the table borders, so it won't have double border</li>
		<li>th - Change color of the heading so it won't be default black text and background color</li>
		<li>td.one - change color of background different from the heading, and use to alternate with td.two to make table read easier</li>
		<li>td.two - change color of background different from heading, and use to alternate with td.one</li>
		<li>subheading - This applies a blue color, bolds it, and is slightly bigger than regular text</li>
		<li>p - Increase the default font size</li>
		<li>a - have it so when you hover over links, it'll change color to red</li>
		<li>img - autocrops the image to specfic height and width</li>
